# About Page Content Instructions

Place your About page content in this folder. Suggested files:

- bio.md: your full bio (supports Markdown)
- highlights.md: bullet points for quick intro
- avatar.jpg/png: optional alternate headshot

Guidance:
- Keep paragraphs short; use headings (##) for sections.
- Links are okay; use full URLs. Images can be referenced from /assets/images/.
- This folder is excluded from publishing; we will ingest these into /index.html.
