Abstract

Dense retrieval models based on transformers have significantly improved informa-
tion retrieval but often require substantial computational resources. In this work,
we introduce a lightweight approach that integrates a Single-Block Mixture-of-
Experts (SB-MoE) layer into TinyBERT-6L, a compact transformer model, to
enhance retrieval effectiveness while maintaining efficiency. Our SB-MoE module
selectively routes input queries to specialized experts, improving representation
learning with minimal additional computational cost. We evaluate our model on the
BEIR benchmark, specifically the SciFact dataset, using retrieval metrics such as
NDCG@10 and Recall@K. Additionally, we leverage Hugging Face’s Trainer API
with mixed-precision and multi-GPU training to optimize performance. Our results
demonstrate that SB-MoE improves retrieval quality while maintaining computa-
tional efficiency, making it a viable solution for real-world, resource-constrained
applications.

Introduction

Modern dense retrieval models, such as those based on transformers like BERT and TinyBERT, play
a crucial role in search and information retrieval tasks. However, these models often face a trade-off
between retrieval performance and computational efficiency, making them challenging to deploy in
resource-constrained environments.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have shown promise in improving model efficiency by
dynamically routing input to specialized experts. However, existing MoE-based retrieval models
often introduce substantial computational overhead, limiting their practical usability. Inspired by prior
work on MoE for dense retrieval, we explore a lightweight integration of MoE into transformer-based
retrieval models, aiming to enhance retrieval performance while maintaining efficiency.

Our proposed approach, Single-Block Mixture-of-Experts (SB-MoE), introduces an MoE module at
the final encoder layer of a transformer-based retrieval model. By incorporating only 2–4 lightweight
experts with a gating mechanism for selective activation, we minimize additional computational costs
while leveraging the benefits of expert specialization. This design is particularly suited for scenarios
requiring high retrieval accuracy with limited computational resources.

Our main contributions include:

• A novel integration of SB-MoE into TinyBERT-based dense retrieval models, providing an

effective balance between performance and efficiency.

• Evaluation of the proposed approach using BEIR benchmark datasets, including SciFact,

measuring improvements in NDCG@10 and Recall@K.

• A detailed analysis of model efficiency, including memory usage and inference speed,

demonstrating the feasibility of our approach for real-world deployment.

This project contributes to the broader effort of making transformer-based dense retrieval models
more practical for deployment in constrained environments, offering an effective method to enhance
retrieval quality with minimal computational trade-offs.

2 Background

Dense retrieval has gained significant attention in recent years due to its effectiveness in various
information retrieval tasks. Traditional sparse retrieval methods, such as BM25, rely on lexical
matching, which can fail to capture the semantic meaning of queries. In contrast, dense retrieval
models encode both queries and documents into continuous vector spaces, allowing for more efficient
and accurate retrieval.

Transformer-based models like BERT have significantly improved retrieval performance, but their
computational cost remains a major challenge. Distillation techniques, such as those used in Tiny-
BERT, reduce model size and inference latency while maintaining performance. However, further
improvements are needed to balance efficiency and effectiveness.

Recent advancements in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have introduced dynamic routing
mechanisms that allocate computational resources more efficiently. By activating only a subset of
experts per input, MoE models achieve scalability while maintaining model capacity. Previous work
has explored MoE in language modeling and retrieval, showing promising results.

3 Method

Our dense retrieval system is based on TinyBERT-6L, a distilled version of BERT with six layers,
making it a computationally efficient choice for large-scale retrieval tasks. However, despite its
efficiency, TinyBERT often underperforms compared to full-scale transformer models in terms of
retrieval effectiveness.

To address this, we incorporate a Single-Block Mixture-of-Experts (SB-MoE) layer into the final en-
coder layer. MoE architectures have shown promise in increasing model capacity without significantly
raising computational costs by dynamically routing inputs to different expert networks.

Our proposed improvement involves integrating an SB-MoE layer into TinyBERT-6L. This layer
consists of 4–8 small feed-forward expert networks, and a gating mechanism dynamically routes
each input (specifically, the [CLS] token) to a single expert using top-1 selection. This ensures that
only one expert is activated per input, minimizing additional computational burden while allowing
specialization among experts.

To further optimize our system, we use the BEIR dataset, specifically the “scifact” dataset, for
training and evaluation. Our training objective employs the InfoNCE contrastive loss, which ensures
that query embeddings are aligned closely with their corresponding document embeddings while
distancing them from irrelevant documents. The model is fine-tuned using Hugging Face’s Trainer
API, leveraging mixed-precision (FP16) training and multi-GPU distributed processing (using DDP)
to enhance speed and memory efficiency.

Our retrieval system is evaluated using FAISS indexing, measuring performance through standard
retrieval metrics such as Recall@K, NDCG@10, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). These metrics
help assess the effectiveness of our approach in improving retrieval quality while maintaining
computational efficiency.

4 Experiments

4.1 Model

Our retrieval system is built upon TinyBERT-6L, a compact six-layer distilled transformer. To
improve retrieval effectiveness while maintaining efficiency, we propose two MoE-enhanced architec-
tures:

SB-MoE: In this approach, we augment TinyBERT by inserting a single MoE block into the final
encoder layer. The SB-MoE layer comprises eight lightweight feedforward expert networks. A gating

2

mechanism routes the [CLS] token to a single expert (top-1 selection) per input, thus increasing
model capacity with minimal added computation. This design is particularly attractive for resource-
constrained environments.

MoE: Complementary to SB-MoE, we also explore a standard Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model.
In this variant, several of the TinyBERT feedforward layers are replaced with full MoE blocks.
Each MoE block employs a gating network that routes tokens to the topk experts (typically k = 2)
and incorporates an auxiliary load-balancing loss to ensure equitable expert utilization. Unlike SB-
MoE—which simply adds an additional block after the base encoder—the full MoE model interleaves
expert routing within the Transformer layers, allowing for richer expert specialization at the cost of
increased complexity. Our baseline for comparison is the fine-tuned TinyBERT-6L without any MoE
enhancements.

4.2 Datasets

We train and evaluate our model on the BEIR benchmark, a comprehensive suite of 18 diverse
retrieval datasets spanning various domains and tasks. BEIR is designed to assess the zero-shot
performance of retrieval models in settings ranging from question-answering to scientific literature
search.

In this work, we focus on the scifact dataset, a challenging benchmark for the verification of
scientific claims. SciFact comprises scientific claims paired with research abstracts, where the
relevant evidence is often confined to a few sentences. This makes it an excellent testbed for
evaluating the precision and semantic understanding of dense retrieval models.

4.3 Baselines

Our primary baseline is the fine-tuned TinyBERT-6L model without any MoE enhancements. By
comparing our proposed SB-MoE and full MoE models against this baseline, we isolate the impact
of expert routing on retrieval performance.

4.4 Code

Our code is publicly available at our GitHub Project Repository. The repository is organized into
modular components that reflect the different model architectures and training pipelines. It contains:

• model.py — Defines the TinyBERT-based model architectures, including the SB-MoE

layer (TinyBERTWithMoE) and the full MoE model (TinyBERTMoERegular).

• train.py — Implements fine-tuning of the baseline TinyBERT model using Hugging

Face’s Trainer API.

• train_sbmoe.py — Fine-tunes the SB-MoE TinyBERT model.

• train_moe.py — Fine-tunes the full MoE TinyBERT model.

• eval.py — Encodes the corpus, builds FAISS indices, and computes retrieval metrics (e.g.,

Recall@K, NDCG@10, MRR) for baseline, SB-MoE, and MoE models.

• utils.py — Contains the InfoNCE loss implementation and helper functions for metric

calculations.

5 Results

Our results compare the retrieval performance of our method with baselines. We evaluate using
three key metrics: Recall@K, which measures how often the relevant document appears in the
top-K results; NDCG@10, a ranking quality metric that accounts for relevance order; and MRR,
which calculates the mean reciprocal rank of the first relevant document. These metrics provide a
comprehensive evaluation of our model’s retrieval capabilities.

Our training curves, shown in Figures 1, illustrate the loss trajectories for baseline TinyBERT, SB-
MoE TinyBERT, and regular MoE TinyBERT, respectively. In all three cases, the training loss
decreases steadily over the first few epochs and eventually converges near zero by epoch 20. Notably,

introducing MoE layers (either as a single block or throughout the transformer) does not disrupt
training stability: Both SB-MoE and Regular MoE follow smooth convergence paths similar to
the baseline model. These trends confirm that our gating and optimization strategies (including
mixed-precision training) effectively integrate the MoE components without introducing instability
or excessive overhead.

Table 1 presents retrieval performance metrics (Recall, NDCG@10, and MRR) for three TinyBERT
variants at different recall settings (Recall@1,5,10). From the table, we observe that while SB-MoE
TinyBERT consistently surpasses the Baseline TinyBERT across all metrics, the Regular MoE

TinyBERT achieves the highest scores overall. This aligns with our expectation that introducing
additional expert layers within the Transformer (as in Regular MoE) yields stronger representations
than a single-block approach (SB-MoE). At the same time, the SB-MoE model remains a practical
improvement over the baseline, indicating that even one lightweight expert block can substantially
boost retrieval effectiveness without incurring the full complexity of a multi-layer MoE design.

It is worth noting that the relatively modest improvements observed for the SB-MoE model over
the baseline TinyBERT can be largely attributed to the simplicity and limited scale of the SciFact
dataset, which was chosen in part to conserve computational resources. The dataset’s narrow domain
and reduced variability in latent features constrain the capacity of the MoE architecture to fully
demonstrate its advantages. We are confident that when evaluated on larger, more heterogeneous
datasets—where a richer diversity of hidden feature classes is present—the enhanced expressiveness
of MoE architectures, particularly the Regular MoE model, will yield more substantial performance
gains.

6 Conclusion

In this work, we demonstrate that integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into a lightweight transformer
like TinyBERT enhances dense retrieval performance while maintaining efficiency. Our comparative
evaluation between the baseline TinyBERT model, SB-MoE, and Regular MoE highlights the
effectiveness of expert routing. We find that even a single-block MoE module (SB-MoE) improves
retrieval effectiveness with minimal computational overhead, making it a practical enhancement
for resource-constrained environments. Meanwhile, the fully integrated MoE model exhibits the
strongest performance, confirming that deeper expert integration allows for richer representation
learning.

Our key takeaways are:

• SB-MoE achieves a strong balance between performance and efficiency. The addition of
a lightweight MoE block improves retrieval effectiveness without significantly increasing
computational cost, making it an appealing trade-off.

• Regular MoE outperforms both SB-MoE and the baseline. By distributing MoE layers
throughout the Transformer, the model achieves superior retrieval performance, confirming
the advantages of deeper expert routing.

• Dataset complexity plays a crucial role in performance gains. The relatively modest
improvement of SB-MoE over the baseline can be attributed to the limited scale of SciFact.
We expect larger and more heterogeneous datasets to better showcase the benefits of expert
specialization.

Future work includes exploring domain-adaptive MoE configurations, where expert layers are fine-
tuned for specific retrieval domains while maintaining generalization. Additionally, investigating
more efficient gating mechanisms could further enhance model scalability. Our results reinforce the
potential of MoE-based sparse activation in making transformer retrieval models both powerful and
practical for real-world deployment.
